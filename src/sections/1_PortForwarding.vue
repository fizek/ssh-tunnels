        | Local port forwarding allows you to forward traffic on the SSH client
        | to some destination through an SSH server. This lets you access
        | remote services over an encrypted connection as if they were local services.
        | Example use cases:
        ul
          li Accessing a remote service (redis, memcached, etc.) listening on internal IPs
          li Locally accessing resources available on a private network
          li Transparently proxying a request to a remote service
    .example
      h4 Remote port forwarding

      p
        | Remote port forwarding allows you to forward traffic on an SSH server
        | to a destination through either the SSH client or another remote host.
        | This gives users on public networks access to resources on private networks.
        | Example use cases:
        ul
          li Making a local development server available over a public network
          li Granting IP-restricted access to a remote resource on a private network
    .example
      h4 Dynamic port forwarding
      .flow-diagram
        annotated-icon(type="laptop" annotation="*:3000" color="#00dcff")
        right-arrow(:ssh="true")
        annotated-icon(type="server" annotation="ssh-server" color="rgb(255,141,0)")
        right-arrow
        annotated-icon(type="cloud" annotation="*:*")
      p
        | Dynamic port forwarding opens a SOCKS proxy on the SSH client that lets
        | you forward TCP traffic through the SSH server to a remote host.

    .example
      h4 Forwarding from privileged ports
      p
        | If you want to open a privileged port (ports 1-1023) to forward traffic, you'll
        | need to run SSH with superuser privileges on the system that opens the port.
      code
        | sudo ssh -L 80:example.com:80 ssh-server
      .flow-diagram
        annotated-icon(type="laptop" annotation="127.0.0.1:80" color="#00dcff")
        right-arrow(:ssh="true")
        annotated-icon(type="server" annotation="ssh-server" color="rgb(255,141,0)")
        right-arrow

    .example
      h4 SSH command-line flags
      p
        | These are some useful SSH command-line flags when establishing tunnels
      code
        | -f
        |   # forks the ssh process into the background
        br
        | -n
        |   # prevents reading from STDIN
        br
        | -N
        |  # do not run remote commands. Used when only forwarding ports
        br
        | -T
        |  # disables TTY allocation
      p
        | Here's an example of a command you would run to create an SSH tunnel
        | in the background that forwards a local port through the ssh server.
      code
        | ssh -fnNT -L 127.0.0.1:8080:example.org:80 ssh-server
      p
        | For brevity, the examples below will leave out these command-line
        | flags.
