      h2 Reliable SSH Tunnels
      h3 How to keep SSH tunnels open through network failures

    .example
      p
        | The commands listed above work on an ad-hoc basis, but if
        | you want to maintain SSH tunnels through network outages or
        | unreliable connections, you'll have to do some additional setup.
      p
        | By default, the TCP connection used to establish an SSH tunnel
        | may time out after a period of inactivity. To prevent timeouts,
        | you can configure the server to send heartbeat messages.

      code
        | ClientAliveInterval 15
        br
        | ClientAliveCountMax 4
      p
        | You can also configure the client to send heartbeat messages.

      h4 Using AutoSSH
      p
        | While the above options may prevent a connection from dropping
        | due to inactivity, they will not re-establish dropped connections.
        | To ensure that an SSH tunnel will be re-established, you can use
        | autossh, which builds an SSH tunnel and monitors its health.
      p
        | AutoSSH accepts the same arguments for port forwarding as SSH.
      code autossh -R 2222:localhost:22 ssh-server

        annotated-icon(type="server" annotation="ssh-server:2222" color="rgb(255,141,0)")
        right-arrow(:ssh="true")
        annotated-icon(type="laptop" annotation="localhost:22" color="#00dcff")
      p
        | This establishes a reverse tunnel that comes back after network failures.
        | By default, AutoSSH will open extra ports on the SSH client and server for
        | health checks. If traffic appears to no longer pass between the health check
        | ports, AutoSSH will restart the SSH tunnel.

    .example
      code
        | autossh -R 2222:localhost:22 \
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;-M 0 \
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;-o "ServerAliveInterval 10" -o "ServerAliveCountMax 3" \
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;remote-host
      p
        | Using the -M 0 flag disables the health check ports and allows the SSH client
        | to handle the health checks. In this example, the SSH client expects the server
        | to send a heartbeat every 10 seconds. If 3 heartbeats fail in a row, the SSH client
        | exits, and AutoSSH will re-establish a new connection.
