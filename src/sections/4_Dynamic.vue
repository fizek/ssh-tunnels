      h2 Dynamic port forwarding
      h3 Forward traffic from a range of ports to a remote server

    .example
      code ssh -D 3000 ssh-server
      .flow-diagram
        annotated-icon(type="laptop" annotation="*:3000" color="#00dcff")
        right-arrow(:ssh="true")
        annotated-icon(type="server" annotation="ssh-server" color="rgb(255,141,0)")
        right-arrow
        annotated-icon(type="cloud" annotation="*:*")
      p
        | Opens a SOCKS proxy on port 3000 of all interfaces on your local system.
        | This allows you to forward traffic sent through the proxy to the ssh-server
        | on any port or destination host. By default, SSH will use the SOCKS5 protocol,
        | which forwards TCP and UDP traffic.

    .example
      code ssh -D 127.0.0.1:3000 ssh-server
      .flow-diagram
        annotated-icon(type="laptop" annotation="127.0.0.1:3000" color="#00dcff")
        right-arrow(:ssh="true")
        annotated-icon(type="server" annotation="ssh-server" color="rgb(255,141,0)")
        right-arrow
        annotated-icon(type="cloud" annotation="*:*")
      p
        | Opens a SOCKS proxy on 127.0.0.1:3000 on your local system.
    p
      | When you have a SOCKS proxy running, you can configure your web browser
      | to use the proxy to access resources as if connections were originating
      | from ssh-server. For example, if ssh-server had access to other servers
      | within a private network, by using using a SOCKS proxy you could access
      | those other servers locally as if you were on the network, without needing
      | to set up a VPN.

    .example
      p
        | When you have a SOCKS proxy running, you can test it like so
      code curl -x socks5://127.0.0.1:12345 https://example.org

    .example
      h4 SSH client configuration
      annotated-icon(type="laptop" annotation="/etc/ssh/ssh_config" color="#00dcff")
      p
        | If you want the SOCKS proxy to be available to more interfaces than just
        | localhost, make sure to enable GatewayPorts on your local system.
      code
        | GatewayPorts yes
      p
        | Since GatewayPorts is being configured on the SSH client here, you can also 
        | configure it with a command-line option instead of ssh_config.
      code
        | ssh -o GatewayPorts=yes -D 3000 ssh-server
