      h4 Transparent access to remote resource on a private network
      p
        | Let's say there's a git repository on a private network that's only accessible
        | through a private server on the network. This server is not accessible to the public
        | internet. You have direct access to the server, but don't have VPN access to the
        | private network.

        annotated-icon(type="server" annotation="git@private-network" color="rgb(255,141,0)")

      p
        | For convenience, you'd like to access this private git repository as if you were
        | connecting to it directly from your local system. If you have SSH access to another
        | server that's accessible from both your local system and the private server, you
        | can accomplish this by establishing an SSH tunnel and using a couple of
        | ProxyCommand directives.

      code ssh -L 127.0.0.1:22:127.0.0.1:2222 intermediate-host
      .flow-diagram
        annotated-icon(type="server" annotation="127.0.0.1:2222" color="#00dcff")
        right-arrow(:ssh="true")
        annotated-icon(type="server" annotation="127.0.0.1:22" color="rgb(255,141,0)")
      p
        | This forwards port 2222 on intermediate-host to port 22 on the private server.
        | Now, if you SSH to port 2222 from intermediate-host, you're connecting to the
        | SSH server on the private server despite the private server not being accessible
        | by the public internet.
      code ssh -p 2222 user@localhost
      p
        | If you'd like to make the backdoor even more convenient, you can add
        | some directives to your local ~/.ssh/config
      code
        | Host git.private.network
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;HostName git.private.network
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;ForwardAgent yes
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;ProxyCommand ssh private nc %h %p
        br
        br
        | Host private
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;HostName localhost
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;Port 2222
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;User private-user
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;ForwardAgent yes
        br
        | &nbsp;&nbsp;ProxyCommand ssh tunnel@intermediate-host nc %h %p

        | network.
